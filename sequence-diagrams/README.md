# Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams model the interactions between objects in a single use case. They illustrate how the different parts of a system interact with each other to carry out a function, and the order in which the interactions occur when a particular use case is executed.

We will be using the Swim Lane Diagram for illustrating our software intra-interactions!
